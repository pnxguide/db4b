![thumbnail](https://github.com/pnxguide/db4b/blob/main/img/thumbnail.jpg?raw=true)

(Intended to be a [SHiT8](https://stupid.hackathon.in.th/8/) project; No offense at all)

The "just-workable" database management system for visually impaired persons. Designated to be the first Thai database management system on [dbdb.io](https://dbdb.io).

## Key Features
- Building tables from eco-friendly wood veneers
- Very persistent with galvanized square steels
- Use ~~the eagle, Little John's best friend,~~ seals (ü¶≠ü¶≠ü¶≠) to deliver SQL queries

## SQL Coverage
- [X] Super restrictive SQL syntax
- [X] But at least be able to create/drop tables
- [X] Do some simple data manipulations
    - [X] Scan
    - [X] Projection
    - [X] Insert data into tables
    - [ ] Filter
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Delete
    - [ ] Join
    - [ ] Subquery

## Modes Available
*(Just a fresh recompilation is required)*
- English mode
- Blind mode
- Seal mode

## Namings are cursed
- The "Catalog" seems to be both storage manager and catalog at the same time (or should we call it *catrage manager*?)
- The "Planner" seems to be both parser and planner at the same time (or should we call it *planser*?)
