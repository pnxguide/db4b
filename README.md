# Database for Blinds (DB4B)

(Intended to be a [SHiT8](https://stupid.hackathon.in.th/8/) project)

The "just-workable" database management system for blinds. Designated to be the first Thai database management system on [dbdb.io](https://dbdb.io).

## Key Features
- Building tables from eco-friendly wood veneers
- Add more extensions with galvanized square steels
- Use the eagle, Little John's best friend, to deliver SQL queries

## SQL Coverage
- [X] CREATE TABLE
- [X] DROP TABLE
- [ ] Common data manipulations
    - [ ] Projection
    - [ ] Filter
    - [ ] Delete
    - [ ] Update
- [X] No Join
- [X] No Subquery

## Namings are cursed
- The "Catalog" seems to be both storage manager and catalog at the same time (or should we call it catrage manager?)
- The "Planner" seems to be both parser and planner at the same time (or should we call it planser?)
