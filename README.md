# Database for Blinds (DB4B)

(Intended to be a [SHiT8](https://stupid.hackathon.in.th/8/) project; No offense in any cases)

## Namings are cursed
- The "Catalog" seems to be both storage manager and catalog at the same time (or should we call it *catrage manager*?)
- The "Planner" seems to be both parser and planner at the same time (or should we call it *planser*?)
